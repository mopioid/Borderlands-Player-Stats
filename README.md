# Borderlands Player Stats

A simple mod for Borderlands 2 and The Pre-Sequel that allows searching and dumping stats about your current save file.

Your save file contains many statistics that are not viewable through any vanilla means; either they can only be seen up to a certain limit in the Badass Rank screen, or they cannot be seen anywhere. This mod allows for you to search for them and print their full values.

To use, simply type the word `stats` in the console, followed by the keyword you would like to search for.
